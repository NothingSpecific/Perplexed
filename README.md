# Perplexed
A lightweight IDE for streamlining development processes.


Perplexed currently supports basic text editing functionality. Eventually it's planned to be a full-featured IDE, but for now, text editing is a good start.

To build:

- Glone this repository and all submodules with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/NothingSpecific/Perplexed.git`
- `cd Perplexed`
- Build with `make`
	- This will also build SDL2 and GLFW

- Install to your local system with `sudo make install`

Perplexed will then be installed as `/usr/local/bin/perplexed` where you can run it as the shell command `perplexed`.
